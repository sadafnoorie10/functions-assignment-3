Generators are defined using a function that uses the `yield` statement to produce a series of values over time, rather than returning a single value and terminating.\n",

        "1. **Lazy Evaluation**: Generators produce values one at a time and only when requested. This is known as lazy evaluation. This makes generators memory-efficient, as they do not require all values to be stored in memory at once.\n",

        "### Explanation\n",
        "- In this example:\n",
        "  - The function `generate_squares` is defined as a generator. It takes one parameter `n` and uses a for loop to iterate from `0` to `n-1`.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Lazy Evaluation**:\n",
        "   - Generators yield values only when requested, meaning they compute results as needed. This can lead to improved performance in scenarios where you don’t need all results at once.\n",

        "3. **Simpler Code**:\n",

        "\n",
        "### Explanation\n",
        "- **Regular Function**:\n",
        "  - In the first example, `generate_numbers(n)` returns a list of numbers from `0` to `n-1`. This means the entire list is created and stored in memory at once, which can consume a lot of memory when `n` is large (e.g., `1,000,000`).\n",

        "Q8) What is a lambda function in python and when is it typically used? give one example.\n",
        "\n",
        "A8) A **lambda function** in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with the `def` keyword, lambda functions can have any number of parameters but can only contain a single expression. The result of this expression is implicitly returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Characteristics of Lambda Functions\n",
        "- **Anonymous**: They do not have a name (hence \"anonymous\").\n",
        "- **Single Expression**: They can only evaluate one expression, which is returned automatically.\n",
        "- **Short and Concise**: Typically used for simple operations that can be defined in a single line of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use Lambda Functions\n",
        "Lambda functions are commonly used in the following scenarios:\n",
        "1. **When you need a simple function for a short period**: When you need a quick, throwaway function for a short operation, such as in functional programming.\n",
        "2. **As arguments to higher-order functions**: They are often used in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`, where you need a function to apply to items in an iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example\n",
        "Here's an example of using a lambda function with the `map()` function:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# A list of numbers\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using a lambda function to square each number\n",
        "squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n",
        "\n",
        "print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Explanation\n",
        "- In this example:\n",
        "  - We have a list of numbers, and we want to square each number in that list.\n",
        "  - The `map()` function applies the lambda function `lambda x: x ** 2` to each item in the `numbers` list.\n",
        "  - The lambda function takes a single argument `x` and returns `x` squared.\n",
        "  - The result is then converted to a list, resulting in `[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary\n",
        "Lambda functions provide a concise way to create small functions for temporary use, especially when working with higher-order functions that expect function objects as arguments. They enhance readability and reduce the amount of code for simple operations. However, for more complex functions or when readability is a concern, it's often better to define a standard function using the `def` keyword."

        "A9) The `map()` function in Python is a built-in function used to apply a given function to all items in an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) and return an iterator that produces the results. It’s a useful tool for transforming data in a concise and efficient manner.\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Transformation**: The primary purpose of `map()` is to transform the elements of an iterable using a specific function.\n",

        "map(function, iterable)\n",

        "The result of `map()` is an iterator, which you can convert to a list or any other collection type if needed.\n",
